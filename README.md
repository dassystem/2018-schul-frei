# 2018 schul-frei

These are slides and images for the schul-frei 2018 conference in August 30th 2018.

I wanted to share them, since somebody might want to use them in his or her own work. 

For every image's copyright credit please consider the HTML notes in .md file.

You'll get best results using `PITCHME.md` together with `reveal-md`.

`reveal-md PITCHME.md --css slidestyle.css -w --theme white`

Have fun

Adrian
